In this project, I did webscraping and NLP processing.
* Scraped http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/party-pictures to get all the picture captions for parties before December 2014.
* Used BeautifulSoup to scrape
* Parsed each caption to get unique set of names.
* Used Nltk to process all the captions data.
* Result: set of names that appeared in the caption.
